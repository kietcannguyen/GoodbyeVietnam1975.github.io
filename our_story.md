*Dinh family

Collective stories from Tho, Thuy, Nong, Vuong, Sang, Phuong, Son, Trang, Dung, and Ngoc point of view. I want to have our family story written down for the present and future generations to know how difficult, daring, fearful, bravery, faith, destiny, and many luck that occurred in this event.  It is an incredible story. This is our family history. 

Thank you Tram Anh, Duan, and Kim for being my support and capturing the stories with me. 

# Timeline 1975

## Fall of Da Nang

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| March 28 | Tho leaves Da Nang Air Force base. He flies to Nha Trang and then to Tan Son Nhut Air Force base.                       |

## Fall of Nha Trang


# Introduction
1975 will forever change the future lives of over 100,000 South Vietnamese people that fled their country and millions more over the next several years. North Vietnam Communist also known as Viet Cong (VC) defeated South Vietnam’s government and took over major cities with the help of the Communist party by Russia and China.  America was in protest of the Vietnam war for years. President Gerald Ford and other US leaderships started to evacuate the US military and ended the Vietnam war on April 30, 1975. 
The 16 South Vietnamese people mentioned in this story never planned to leave their country until the collapse of the Vietnam war. At the time, 12 members of the group were teenagers, young adults, grandparents, and 4 children under the age of five. Three of the men were serving the South Vietnam Air Force. It was a journey they will never forget.

# March 28, 1975
## Da Nang
Morning - Tho was with his nephew, Le, that morning riding on the Suzuki bike. All of a sudden, the rockets were falling from the sky. The VC had taken action to attack Da Nang. Tho asked Le to come with him to Da Nang Air Force base. He can fly them out of Da Nang. Le declined the offer and stayed back to be with his family. Tho knew he could not stay. This was the sign that he will not be coming back to this city again. He gave Le his Suzuki bike. Once Tho arrived at Da Nang Air Force base, South Vietnam Air Force high ranking military officers had already abandoned and flew off on larger planes. The few planes left on base were small Cessna. Hoc was Tho’s friend and a plane mechanic. Hoc made a deal with Tho months ago that if something were to happen on base then he was to have a plane ready for them. They would escape and leave together since Tho was a pilot and knew how to operate a plane. That day, Hoc had a Cessna O-1 plane ready for Tho’s arrival.  Cessna O-1 seats for 2 people. Hoc and 4 other men crammed into the plane. As Tho was taking off on the runway, he noticed the VC had wired explosives near the area.  He had very little runway for the plane to take off. If he hit the explosive, the plane would explode. If he pulled up the plane without enough force, the plane would crash. He was able to gradually lift the plane barely above the explosives and safely flew to Nha Trang.

# Nha Trang
Mid-Afternoon – Tho arrived at Nha Trang Air Force base to refuel his plane and went to see his family. He went to his in-law’s house to meet his wife and infant daughter. He was informed that his mother, sister, brother-in-law, nieces, and nephews from Da Lat were in Nha Trang since the VC invaded their town. They were staying at a relative’s home. Tho went to visit his mother and family and took his wife and daughter along. Once he arrived, his mother held his daughter. This was the first and last time she will know her grand-daughter. It was a very short visit. After they said their goodbye, he took his wife and daughter back to his in-laws. He could not stay in Nha Trang for long. He told them he will be heading to Saigon stationed at Tan Son Nhut Air Force base. He could not take his family with him since he was on duty and feared punishment for flying women and children on the aircraft that was unauthorized. 

# Saigon
Evening - Tho flew and landed at Tan Son Nhut Air Force base. He did not have a permit from Da Nang to station at this location. He was worried he would be punished when he arrived. However, the news about the VC attack at Da Nang Air Force base was approved for him to stay on base.
