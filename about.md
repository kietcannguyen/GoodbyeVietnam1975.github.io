*Dinh family

Collective stories from Tho, Thuy, Nong, Vuong, Sang, Phuong, Son, Trang, Dung, and Ngoc point of view.
I want to have our family story written down for the present and future generations to know how difficult, daring, fearful, bravery, faith, destiny, and many luck that occurred in this event.
It is an incredible story. This is our family history.

Thank you Tram Anh, Duan, and Kim for being my support and capturing the stories with me.
